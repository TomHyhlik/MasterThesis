% co je LPWAN
\section{About LPWAN}
\textit{"Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are the
evolution of wireless sensor networks (WSN) for long
range Internet of Things (IoT) applications."} \cite{MURS Band for LPWAN Applications}
This kind of networks differ from custom wireless sensor networks (WSN) with focus on low power, low cost, scalability and extended range.
It has no such emphasis on high data rates and low latency \cite{MURS Band for LPWAN Applications}.

\section{The expected LPWAN growth in the future}
The industry of LPWAN in concept of IoT is growing due to its huge potential.
Cisco study \cite{IoT cisco study} says that IoT will be combined with other technologies such as artifical inteligence (AI), fog computing and blockchain. Such combination of technologies will provide greater value of investment for companies. 
The IoT security becomes one of the most relevant requirements.
More organizations will become to cooperate with each other in solution development.
More open standards, open architectures and regulations is to come in the future.
todo: popsat vic jak se IoT vyviji, pripadne najit dalsi studii.
